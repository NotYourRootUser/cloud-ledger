# Cloud Ledger

This is my log as I learn cloud security and architecture. I update this repo as I progress through Security Plus and AWS work.

Current focus:
Security Plus
AWS Solutions Architect Associate

## Weekly Security Plus Notes

These folders contain notes and diagrams for each week. The goal is to learn the concepts and then apply them to real cloud environments.

Week 1 Attacks and Vulnerabilities  
[week1 sec+](./week1%20sec+)

Week 2 Firewalls VPN IDS IPS  
[week2 sec+](./week2%20sec+)

Week 2.1 DMZ and Network Flow Fixups  
[week%202.1](./week%202.1)

Week 3 Threat Intelligence Attack Surfaces IOC  
[week3 sec+](./week3%20sec+)

Week 4 Secure Components and Monitoring  
[week4 sec+](./week4%20sec+)

Main learning anchor:
Flow before firewall. I draw traffic first and then add controls.

## About This Repo

I learn by doing. I document everything to track progress. Mistakes stay in commit history because they show what I fixed. This repo is a working journal while I move toward cloud and security engineering.

LinkedIn link will be added later once deployment projects are live.
