# Cloud Ledger

This is my personal log while I learn cloud and security.  
I’m using this repo to track what I study, practice, and build as I go through certifications and small projects.

Current focus: **CompTIA Security+** and **AWS Solutions Architect Associate**  
*(I’ll keep adding more as I progress.)*
