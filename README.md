# Cloud Ledger

This is my log as I learn cloud security and architecture. I update this repo as I progress through Security Plus and AWS work.

Current focus:
Security Plus
AWS Solutions Architect Associate

## Weekly Security Plus Notes

These folders contain notes and diagrams for each week. The goal is to learn the concepts and then apply them to real cloud environments.

Week 1 Attacks and Vulnerabilities  
[week1 sec+](./week1%20sec+)

Week 2 Firewalls VPN IDS IPS  
[week2 sec+](./week2%20sec+)

Week 2.1 DMZ and Network Flow Fixups  
[week%202.1](./week%202.1)

Week 3 Threat Intelligence Attack Surfaces IOC  
[week3 sec+](./week3%20sec+)

Week 4 Secure Components and Monitoring  
[week4 sec+](./week4%20sec+)

Main learning anchor:
Flow before firewall. I draw traffic first and then add controls.

## Labs and Projects

Hands on practice where I link Security Plus topics to AWS.

AWS and Security Plus labs are in the projects folder.

[projects](./projects)

## Quick Notes Index

Topics I reference often:

Threat actors notes  
[domain 2.1](./week3%20sec+/domain_2.1)

Attack surface and attack vectors  
[domain 2.2](./week3%20sec+/domain_2.2)

Indicators of compromise  
[domain 2.3](./week3%20sec+/domain_2.3)

Secure DNS and DNS filtering  
[secure dns notes](./week4%20sec+/secure_dns_notes.md)

This section will keep growing.

## Diagrams

I use diagrams to understand network flow and controls.

Examples can be found here:

## Next Goals

Deploy my portfolio site on AWS S3 and CloudFront with proper IAM access  
Finish VPC Phase 3 security controls  
Start Terraform basics for repeatable infrastructure  
Add CloudWatch logs and network telemetry  
Keep improving structure and linking inside this repo

## About This Repo

I learn by doing. I document everything to track progress. Mistakes stay in commit history because they show what I fixed. This repo is a working journal while I move toward cloud and security engineering.

LinkedIn link will be added later once deployment projects are live.
