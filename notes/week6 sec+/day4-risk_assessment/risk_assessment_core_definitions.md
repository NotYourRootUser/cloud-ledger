# Risk Assessment Core Definitions

## Likelihood
The probability that a specific threat will exploit a vulnerability and cause harm to an asset.

## Impact
The degree of damage or loss if a threat successfully exploits a vulnerability. Often measured in financial, operational, or reputational terms.

## Qualitative Risk Assessment
Uses descriptive ratings (like low, medium, high) to measure likelihood and impact based on expert judgment or experience.

## Quantitative Risk Assessment
Uses numerical values (like dollars or percentages) to measure risk. Relies on actual data for loss expectancy calculations.

## Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
The expected monetary loss each time a risk event occurs.  
**Formula:** SLE = Asset Value × Exposure Factor

## Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
How often a specific risk is expected to happen per year. Example: once every five years = 0.2 ARO.

## Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
The total yearly cost of a risk based on its frequency and loss per event.  
**Formula:** ALE = SLE × ARO

## Risk Treatment Options
- **Accept:** Acknowledge the risk and do nothing beyond monitoring.  
- **Avoid:** Remove the cause of the risk entirely.  
- **Mitigate:** Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact.  
- **Transfer:** Shift the risk to a third party (for example, insurance or contracts).

## Business Impact Analysis (BIA) Output
Identifies critical functions, maximum tolerable downtime (MTD), recovery time objectives (RTO), recovery point objectives (RPO), and the financial or operational impact of disruptions.
