# Policy Hierarchy Domain 5

## Definitions

- **Policy** is the mandatory rule that states _what_ must be done and _why_.
- A **Standard** is the minimum measurable requirement that supports the policy.
- **Procedure** is the step-by-step instructions that explain _how_ to meet the standard.
- **Guideline** - Recommended best practices that are optional and flexible.

## Analogys

**Driving laws model:**

- Policy = the **law** you must follow
- Standard = the **speed limits** enforcing minimum expectations
- Procedure = **driving instructions** that show how to comply
- Guideline = the **safety tips** that help you avoid mistakes

→ Policies lead → Standards enforce → Procedures instruct → Guidelines advise

## Reverse / Challenging the Assumptions

### What if guidelines became enforced like policies?

- Users would be forced to follow advice that doesn’t fit every scenario.
- Creativity and rapid problem-solving would shrink under rigidity.
- Audit confusion: what is mandatory vs recommended becomes unclear → compliance disputes.

### What if there was no review cadence for policies?

- Policies would become outdated as technology and threats evolve.
- Weak or broken controls might stay in place for years without scrutiny.
- Regulators and auditors see stale policies as red flags → compliance failure.

### What if exceptions had no expiry or tracking?

- Orphaned permissions accumulate and create hidden attack paths.
- Insiders can retain elevated access long after the need is gone.
- Breach investigations stall because no one knows who approved what.
