# Domain 5.1 — Governance Foundations  
Charter • RACI • Authority to Act  
Anchor Phase — ARX Aligned

---

### Charter
A formal document that grants the security team **authority**, **scope**, and an **executive sponsor** to enforce controls.  
Analogy: a **badge + warrant** empowering security to act even when others resist.  
Visual: a **sealed, signed authorization document**.

---

### RACI Matrix
Clarifies who **does the work**, who **owns the outcome**, who **advises before**, and who **receives updates after**.

| Role | Meaning | Timing | Example |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| Responsible | Executes the task | During | Security engineer applying controls |
| Accountable | **Owns** success or failure (only **one**) | Before/After | CISO reporting to leadership |
| Consulted | Expert input influencing action | Before | IAM specialist advising policy |
| Informed | Updated on progress/outcomes | After | Stakeholders receiving incident reports |

Memory: **Do • Own • Advise Before • Hear After**  
Analogy: football — players (R), coach (A), assistants (C), audience (I)  
Visual: a **4-column table** with names locked in each role

---

### Authority to Act
The power for security to **enforce controls**, **halt risky actions**, and **escalate when needed**.  
Analogy: a **referee whistle** that immediately stops the game.  
Visual: a **red “SECURITY ONLY” door** with a keycard lock.

### Governance Integration Summary

| Control | Purpose | If Missing |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Charter | Establish mandate and support | Security ignored or bypassed |
| RACI | Clear accountability and roles | Confusion and stalled action |
| Authority to Act | Enforce and escalate decisions | Risk continues unchecked |

Security governance requires **clarity + power**.  
Advice without enforcement is ignored.
