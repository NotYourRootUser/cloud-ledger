# Domain 5.1 / Governance Foundations  
Charter • RACI • Authority to Act  
Anchoring info

---

### Charter
A formal document that grants the security team **authority**, **scope**, and an **executive sponsor** to enforce controls. Kind of like a **badge + warrant** empowering security to act even when others resist. When i think of Charter i picture a **sealed, signed authorization document**.  

---

### RACI Matrix
Clarifies who **does the work**, who **owns the outcome**, who **advises before**, and who **receives updates after**.

| Role | Meaning | Timing | Example |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| Responsible | Executes the task | During | Security engineer applying controls |
| Accountable | **Owns** success or failure (only **one**) | Before/After | CISO reporting to leadership |
| Consulted | Expert input influencing action | Before | IAM specialist advising policy |
| Informed | Updated on progress/outcomes | After | Stakeholders receiving incident reports |

**Do • Own • Advise Before • Hear After** like football: players (R), coach (A), assistants (C), audience (I). I picture it as a **4-column table** with names locked in each role

---

### Authority to Act
The power for security to **enforce controls**, **halt risky actions**, and **escalate when needed,** like a **referee whistle** that immediately stops the game. I picture **red “SECURITY ONLY” door** with a keycard lock when I think of **authority to act.**

### Governance Integration 

| Control | Purpose | If Missing |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Charter | Establish mandate and support | Security ignored or bypassed |
| RACI | Clear accountability and roles | Confusion and stalled action |
| Authority to Act | Enforce and escalate decisions | Risk continues unchecked |

Security governance requires **clarity + power**.  
Advice without enforcement is ignored.
