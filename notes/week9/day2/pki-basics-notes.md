# PKI Basics Study Notes

## Certificate Authority (CA)
Trusted entity that signs and issues digital certificates. Validates identity and vouches for authenticity.

## Intermediate CA
Delegated signer below the root CA. Issues end-user/server certificates to protect root exposure.

## Leaf / Server Certificate
Certificate installed on servers and presented to clients (e.g., HTTPS sites). Proves server identity.

## Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
Generated by an entity requesting a certificate. Contains public key and identity data for CA verification and signing.

## Private Key Location
Private key remains securely stored on the owner’s system (server, hardware module, secure enclave). Never leaves its environment.

## OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)
Live certificate revocation check. Responds with “good,” “revoked,” or “unknown.” Faster than CRLs.

## CRL (Certificate Revocation List)
Downloaded list containing revoked certificate IDs. Used for offline or periodic revocation checks.

# OCSP vs CRL Failure Conditions
- OCSP can soft-fail if responder unavailable or stapling absent.
- CRLs lag because updates occur only on refresh intervals and file sizes grow large.

Result: stale trust windows where revoked certificates may still be accepted.

# PKI Trust Chain

Root CA
↓
Intermediate CA
↓
Server / Leaf Certificate
↓
Client validates chain

Trust flows downward from the root and is validated upward by the client.

# Key Insight
PKI functions like a digital passport system:
Root CA = sovereign authority  
Intermediate CA = embassy issuing passports  
Leaf certificate = passport  
OCSP/CRL = border control checking revocation  
Private key = secure stamp machine that must never be stolen
