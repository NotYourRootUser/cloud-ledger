# Threat Actors Summary

## Nation State
Government backed attackers with high funding and long term goals.  
Focus on espionage, infrastructure disruption, and strategic advantage.

## Insider Threat
People already within the organisation who misuse access.  
Motives include malice, negligence, coercion, or personal gain.

## Hacktivists
Ideology driven attackers seeking attention or political impact.  
Often noisy and reputation focused rather than stealthy.

## Criminal Syndicates
Organised crime groups motivated by financial profit.  
Use ransomware, fraud, phishing, and extortion.

## Competitors
Rival organisations using espionage or covert actions to gain advantage.  
Targets include IP theft and market disruption.

## Shadow IT
Unapproved systems or tools used without governance oversight.  
Often accidental but creates hidden risk and attack paths.

## Relative Capability Lens
Nation state is typically highest capability.  
Criminal syndicates have strong operational capability for profit.  
Competitors are targeted and refined.  
Hacktivists vary in skill but focus on disruption.  
Insiders are unpredictable and dangerous due to legitimacy.  
Shadow IT amplifies insider risk and creates unseen exposure.
