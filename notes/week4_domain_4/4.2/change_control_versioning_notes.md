# Change Control and Versioning Notes

## Anchor
Change control tracks configuration modifications and ensures accountability. 
Every change requires documentation, testing, and approval. 
Git provides version history, so engineers can see who changed what and when. 
In cloud environments, GitOps workflows combine change control with automation.

## Reverse
Skipping change review for urgent fixes risks downtime or breaches. 
Without version control, admins canâ€™t revert or trace misconfigurations. 
Strong change management improves recovery speed and organizational trust.
