# IDS vs IPS vs NIDS / HIDS Notes

IDS stands for Intrusion Detection System. It watches network or host activity and alerts when something looks suspicious.
IPS stands for Intrusion Prevention System. It does the same but can block attacks in real time.
NIDS is network based. It watches traffic across network segments.
HIDS is host based. It runs on individual systems and monitors logs, processes, and file changes.

IDS is like a security camera that records what happens.
IPS is like a security guard that steps in to stop trouble.
NIDS gives a wide view of the network, while HIDS sees what happens inside each machine.

If an IPS blocks too aggressively it can interrupt normal work and cause downtime. False positives can make people stop trusting alerts.
