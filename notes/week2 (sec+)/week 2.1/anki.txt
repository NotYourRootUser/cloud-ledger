What is the main purpose of a bastion host (jump box)?	To provide a single hardened entry point for administrators to access private systems securely, isolating management traffic from the internet.
Where should a bastion host be placed in a cloud network?	In a public subnet with strict inbound rules; it connects to private subnets that contain internal instances.
Why use AWS SSM Session Manager instead of SSH?	It removes key management and direct network exposure, allowing audited, keyless, browser-based or CLI sessions.
What’s the difference between a firewall and a WAF?	A firewall filters network packets by IP/port (Layer 3–4); a WAF filters HTTP/S traffic by content and behavior (Layer 7).
Where is a DMZ placed in a typical network design?	Between the external and internal firewalls; it hosts public-facing services like web or mail servers.
How does network segmentation improve security?	It limits lateral movement by isolating systems into VLANs or subnets with ACLs controlling traffic between them.
What is the rule order in ACL evaluation?	Top-down; first match wins, so deny/allow order determines final traffic behavior.
What’s the function of NAT in security architecture?	It hides internal IP addresses, translating private to public, reducing attack surface and enabling outbound access.
What is a VPN used for?	To create an encrypted tunnel for secure remote access or site-to-site communication across untrusted networks.
How do IDS and IPS differ?	IDS detects and alerts on suspicious traffic; IPS detects and automatically blocks or drops malicious traffic.
Where should IDS/IPS be placed in a network?	IDS before the internal firewall for visibility; IPS inline between trusted zones to block real-time threats.
What’s the key difference between Security Groups and NACLs in AWS?	Security Groups are stateful and instance-level; NACLs are stateless and subnet-level.
How does a load balancer improve security and reliability?	It distributes traffic evenly, hides internal servers, and can integrate with WAF or TLS termination for protection.
What is the purpose of a proxy server?	It intermediates requests, masking client identity, enforcing content policies, and caching traffic.
What principle defines the Zero-Trust model?	Never trust, always verify — continuous authentication, authorization, and least-privilege enforcement.
What is defense-in-depth?	Layering multiple security controls (technical, administrative, physical) to ensure no single point of failure.
What AWS service can help centralize logging and monitoring of network traffic?	Amazon CloudWatch or GuardDuty integrated with VPC Flow Logs.
Why deploy bastion hosts across multiple Availability Zones?	For high availability — if one AZ fails, another bastion remains accessible for admin operations.
What’s the main benefit of disabling public IPs on private EC2 instances?	Prevents direct internet access, reducing exposure and forcing all access through secure gateways like bastions or VPNs.
How do IAM policies reinforce architecture security?	They enforce least privilege and restrict who can modify or access network components.
What is a common pitfall when configuring ACLs?	Placing an allow rule before a deny rule that should take precedence, unintentionally permitting unwanted traffic.
What does “stateful” mean in firewall behavior?	It tracks connection states and automatically allows return traffic; stateless devices require explicit rules both ways.
Why log administrative access on bastion hosts?	For accountability, audit trails, and incident response to detect unauthorized or risky activity.
What is the difference between availability and redundancy?	Availability ensures continuous operation; redundancy provides backups or duplicates to support availability.
Why is subnet isolation critical in multi-tier design?	It confines compromise to one layer (web, app, DB) and enforces control boundaries between trust zones.
What’s the primary purpose of a DMZ firewall rule set?	To tightly control inbound access to public services and restrict outbound flow to internal networks.
What architectural control enforces compartmentalization between tenants or environments?	Network segmentation using VLANs, VPCs, or micro-segmentation policies.
What is the security risk of using shared jump boxes without proper IAM?	Loss of accountability and potential privilege escalation — sessions become untraceable.
How does using an NLB in front of bastion hosts enhance resilience?	It provides fault tolerance, distributes SSH/RDP traffic, and ensures consistent access across AZs.
Why combine VPN access with bastion hosts?	VPN provides encrypted tunnels; bastions add an extra layer of authentication and logging before private access.
What layer do WAFs operate on in the OSI model?	Layer 7 (Application layer).
What concept ensures users have only the access they need to perform their job?	Principle of least privilege.
What is the benefit of infrastructure-as-code for security architecture?	Repeatable, version-controlled deployments that reduce misconfiguration risk.
What is the advantage of using parameter stores for credentials?	Keeps secrets out of code and maintains encrypted, controlled access.
How does a proxy cache improve both performance and security?	It serves cached content to reduce load while filtering or blocking malicious traffic patterns.
What does a misconfigured ACL risk causing?	Accidental exposure of private resources or unintended service outages.
Why monitor VPC Flow Logs?	To detect abnormal connections, troubleshoot traffic paths, and identify unauthorized access attempts.
What’s the difference between a forward proxy and a reverse proxy?	Forward proxy sits before clients to control outbound access; reverse proxy sits before servers to manage inbound requests.
How does encryption in transit differ from encryption at rest?	In transit protects data over the network; at rest protects stored data on disks or backups.
Why is least privilege applied to security groups important?	Reduces attack surface by allowing only the minimal required ports and protocols.
What is a jump host’s main audit advantage?	Centralizes all administrative access logs for analysis and compliance.
Why are multi-AZ bastion deployments considered best practice?	They ensure continuous admin access even during AZ outages and meet high-availability requirements.
