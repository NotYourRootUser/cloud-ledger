# Threat Actors • Vectors • Malware • Hardening • Defense in Depth  
Security+

## 1. Threat Actors
- Individuals or groups performing malicious activity.
- Types: Script kiddies, insiders, hacktivists, cybercriminals, APTs, nation-states.
- Key patterns observed in exam questions:
  - APTs = long-term, stealthy, supply-chain, credential theft.
  - Insiders = bypass external controls, use legitimate access.

## 2. Attack Vectors
- The path used to gain initial access.
- Core vectors:
  - Phishing / spear-phishing
  - Removable media (USB)
  - Credential harvesting / session hijacking
  - Drive-by downloads
  - Supply-chain compromise
- Exam cues:
  - “Self-spreading” → NOT a vector, that’s the malware behavior.
  - “User interaction required” → attachment → phishing/trojan/dropper.
  - “Zero user action” → worm / exploit-based vector.

## 3. Malware Types
- **Trojan**: Malicious inside something legitimate.
- **Worm**: Self-replicates without user action.
- **Rootkit**: Hides processes, kernel manipulation.
- **Dropper**: Initial small file that downloads payload.
- **RAT**: Remote-control access after phishing or trojan delivery.
- **Ransomware**: Encryption + potential worm-like spread.

## 4. Hardening
- Reduce attack surface by:
  - Removing default accounts.
  - Disabling unused ports/services.
  - Enforcing MFA.
  - Patch management.
  - Applying CIS/STIG baselines.
- Exam rule:
  - Hardening prevents **known** exploits, not zero-days.

## 5. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers working together so if one fails, another catches the breach.
- Layers:
  - Perimeter (firewall)
  - Detection (IDS/IPS, EDR)
  - Identity (IAM, MFA)
  - Segmentation (VLANs, subnet isolation)
  - Training (user behavior)
- Exam cues:
  - “Firewall failed but EDR caught it” → defense in depth.
  - “Pivot was possible” → lack of defense in depth (no segmentation).

## 6. Useful info
- USB auto-installs backdoor → **removable media vector**
- Vendor update server compromised → **APT + supply-chain**
- Malware hides processes in kernel → **rootkit**
- Hardened server still hit by zero-day but EDR responds → **defense in depth**
- Fake login page → session cookie stolen → **session hijacking**
- Malware spreads via SMB + hashes → **worm-like + credential replay**

## 7. Quick model

> Threat actors exploit vectors to deliver malware; hardening blocks the path; defense in depth ensures survival when a layer fails.
