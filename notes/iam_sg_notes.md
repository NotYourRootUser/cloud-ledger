# IAM & Security Group Notes

- **IAM Role** = Temporary identity with assumed permissions
- **IAM Policy** = Defines what an identity can/cannot do
- **Security Group (SG)** = Stateful firewall at instance level
- SG inbound/outbound rules
- SGs are **stateful** (allow return traffic automatically)
