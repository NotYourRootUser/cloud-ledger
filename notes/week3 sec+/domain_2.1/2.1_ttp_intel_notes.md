# Domain 2.1 — Threat Actors & TTP

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework
The **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** documents how attackers achieve their objectives by mapping **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** observed in real-world intrusions.  
It provides a **common language** for defenders to describe, analyze, and detect adversary behaviors.

---

## Kill Chain
The **Cyber Kill Chain** outlines the sequential stages an attacker may follow to achieve their goal — from reconnaissance to exfiltration.  
It helps defenders identify **where** and **how** to detect or disrupt an attack.

---

## Attribution
**Attribution** is the process of identifying *who* conducted an attack and *where* it originated.  
This is difficult because attackers use obfuscation techniques to hide their identity and location.

---

## Kill Chain Stages

### Reconnaissance
**Reconnaissance** — Gathering intelligence on the target using OSINT (open-source intelligence), scanning, and enumeration.

### Weaponization
**Weaponization** — Preparing the exploit or malicious payload (e.g., embedding malware in a document).

### Delivery
**Delivery** — Transmitting the payload via phishing emails, malicious links, or infected USB drives.

### Exploitation
**Exploitation** — Executing the malicious code on the target system (e.g., user opens infected file).

### Installation
**Installation** — Establishing persistence (e.g., installing a backdoor or remote access tool).

### Command and Control (C2)
**C2 (Command and Control)** — The attacker communicates with compromised systems to issue commands and maintain control.

### Actions on Objectives
**Actions on Objectives** — Achieving the final goal: exfiltrating data, disrupting operations, or causing damage.

## MITRE ATT&CK Techniques
Examples of MITRE techniques include:  
- **Phishing** – delivering malicious payloads or harvesting credentials  
- **Credential Dumping** – extracting stored passwords or hashes  
- **Lateral Movement** – spreading across systems to gain wider access  
- **Data Exfiltration** – stealing sensitive data from the environment  

---

## Mapping Examples / Notes
- **Phishing** aligns with **Delivery**, as it’s how an exploit reaches a target.  
- **Credential Dumping** can occur during **C2** or **Actions on Objectives** depending on attacker goals.  
- **Lateral Movement** relates to **C2** or **Installation**, enabling spread across systems.  
- **Data Exfiltration** maps to **Actions on Objectives**, where attackers steal or leak data.

---

## Attribution Challenges
- **Proxy Infrastructure** – attackers chain servers to hide origin.  
- **False Flags** – fake indicators planted to mislead analysts.  
- **Shared Malware Code** – reused code blurs group attribution.  
- **Timezone Spoofing** – altered timestamps to confuse investigators.  
- **Confidence Levels** – analysts assign *low, medium, or high* based on evidence correlation.

---

## Intelligence Sources
- **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** – public data, news, social media, open feeds.  
- **HUMINT (Human Intelligence)** – insider reports, informants.  
- **SIGINT (Signals Intelligence)** – intercepted network traffic, C2 communication analysis.  
- **SOC Data / ISAC Feeds** – shared indicators from threat intelligence communities.

---

## Scenario Examples
- Analyst traces ransomware using MITRE ATT&CK → finds **T1059 PowerShell Execution** → links to known group.  
- Analyst correlates phishing domains registered in a Russian timezone → assigns **medium-confidence** nation-state attribution.

---

## Conclusions
Threat actors operate in recognizable patterns.  
Frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK** and **Kill Chain** help defenders map those behaviors.  
**Attribution is probabilistic, not certain** — defense should focus on **indicators and response speed**, not blame.

---

## Summary Line
**Actor → Motive → TTP** = Full picture of a threat.
