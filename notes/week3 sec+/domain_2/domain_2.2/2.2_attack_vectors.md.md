# Domain 2.2 — Threat Vectors & Attack Surfaces  
### Session 1 Notes — Attack Vectors (What and How They Work)

This session focused on understanding **how attackers reach their targets** — the specific paths or methods called **attack vectors**.  
Each vector takes advantage of either human mistakes or technical weaknesses to gain access, steal data, or cause damage.

---

## What is an Attack Vector?

An **attack vector** is the path or method an attacker uses to reach a target system or user.  
It’s basically *how the attack starts* — the way a threat actor delivers malware, steals credentials, or tricks someone into action.

---

## Common Attack Vectors

### 1. Email (Phishing)
- Attackers send fake or convincing emails pretending to be trusted sources.
- Goal: trick users into clicking malicious links, opening attachments, or giving up credentials.
- Example: “Reset your password now” emails that lead to fake login pages.

### 2. Web / Application Attacks
- Exploiting flaws in websites or apps.
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** injecting malicious code into web pages seen by other users.
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** entering database commands into forms to read or change data.
- Example: A login form that lets someone type `OR 1=1;--` and gain admin access.

### 3. Removable Media
- Infected USB drives, CDs, or external hard drives used to deliver malware.
- Example: Someone finds a “free USB” and plugs it in, unknowingly installing malware.

### 4. Supply Chain Attacks
- Attackers target third-party vendors or software updates instead of direct victims.
- Example: SolarWinds breach — malicious code was hidden inside trusted updates.

### 5. Wireless Attacks
- Target Wi-Fi networks or Bluetooth connections.
- Example: Rogue access points or “evil twin” hotspots that collect data from users.

### 6. Cloud / API Exploits
- Attackers abuse exposed cloud interfaces or misconfigured APIs.
- Example: Public S3 bucket leaking customer data or stolen API keys giving full access.

### 7. IoT / OT Devices
- Internet-connected devices (sensors, cameras, machines) often lack security updates.
- Example: Default passwords or open ports on smart devices allow remote access.

### 8. Physical Access
- Attacker gains hands-on control of a system.
- Example: Stealing a laptop, plugging in a malicious USB, or planting a keylogger.

### 9. Social Engineering Channels
- Using communication channels to trick humans directly:
  - **Vishing** — voice phishing over the phone.
  - **Smishing** — phishing through SMS/text.
  - **Quishing** — QR codes leading to fake sites.
- Example: Text message saying “Your package is delayed, click here to track.”

## Scenarios

- **Email Vector:** Employee receives a fake IT email asking to “verify credentials.” They enter their details, giving attackers internal access.  
- **Web Vector:** Unpatched web form allows SQL injection, leading to full database exposure.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Attack vectors are **the doors and windows** into systems.  
- They can be **technical** (like SQL injection) or **human-focused** (like phishing).  
- Defenders must know every entry method to **detect, block, or reduce** these paths.

---

**Summary Line:**  
Attack vectors show *how attacks begin* — by exploiting people, code, or systems to start a compromise.
