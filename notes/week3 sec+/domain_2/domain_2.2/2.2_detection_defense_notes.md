# Domain 2.2 — Threat Vectors & Attack Surfaces  
### Session 3 Notes — Impact, Detection & Defense  

This one was about putting everything together — how the different attack vectors *behave*, what kind of *damage* they can do, and how we can *detect* and *defend* against them.  
Basically the “so what?” part of the whole domain.

## Comparing Vectors

Not all attack paths work the same way. Some rely on **people**, others rely on **code**.

### Social vs Technical Attacks
- **Social attacks** (like phishing, vishing, smishing, quishing) trick humans into doing something — clicking a bad link, sharing a password, scanning a fake QR code.  
  - **Detection:** usually by user reports or login anomalies.  
  - **Defense:** training, MFA, anti-phishing filters, verification habits.

- **Technical attacks** (like XSS, SQLi, or API abuse) target code or configurations.  
  - **Detection:** through IDS/IPS, WAF alerts, or log analysis.  
  - **Defense:** patching, input validation, least privilege, segmentation.

Social = psychology.  
Technical = math and code.  
Both hurt, just in different ways.

## Detection Differences

- **Social Engineering:**  
  - Hard to spot automatically because it looks like normal communication.  
  - Best detected by user awareness and strong identity controls.

- **Code Exploits:**  
  - Easier to detect through behavior — weird network traffic, unexpected queries, privilege jumps.  
  - Tools: EDR, IDS/IPS, SIEM logs.

- **Cloud or API misuse:**  
  - Often silent — access keys abused for weeks before anyone notices.  
  - Detection comes from audit logs and anomaly monitoring.

## Impact Levels

|  Attack Type   |                Impact                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Phishing       | Credential theft, account takeover.   |
| SQL Injection  | Data theft or corruption              |
| Ransomware     | Business downtime, financial loss     |
| Supply Chain   | Mass compromise, hard to contain      |
| Insider Attack | Targeted, data leaks, reputation loss |

some attacks break systems, some break trust.

## Scenarios 

- **Phishing vs Exploit:**  
  Company A hit with phishing → 5 users gave passwords → attacker logged in.  
  Company B hit with SQLi → database dumped → website defaced.  
  Both caused chaos, but one exploited humans, the other exploited code.

- **Cloud API gone wrong:**  
  Developer left API keys in GitHub → attacker scraped them → drained S3 data.  
  Detection came from huge bandwidth spike and AWS GuardDuty alert.

## Voice Reflection 

When you start comparing these, you realize detection is never about one tool.  
It’s about patterns — who clicked, what logs changed, what suddenly got encrypted.  
The “defense” part isn’t one product, it’s the layers: training + patching + monitoring.  
And the faster you detect, the smaller the impact.  
Speed is everything here.

## Compression Summary

> Vector = **how** the attack starts.  
> Surface = **where** it lands.  
> Detection = **how** we spot it.  
> Defense = **how** we stop it.  

Attack vectors show how attacks begin.  
Attack surfaces show where they can hit.  
Detection and defense decide how fast we recover.

---

**Final Line:**  
Everything connects — actor → motive → vector → surface → detection → defense.  
That chain is the full story of how cyber attacks happen and how defenders fight back.
