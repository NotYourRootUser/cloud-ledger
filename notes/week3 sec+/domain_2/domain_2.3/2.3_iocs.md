# Session 1 — Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

---

### What to look for
- **Flagged IPs / unusual IP patterns** → show up in SIEM or network monitoring tools.  
  Often repeated, timed, or from odd countries. Could point to beaconing or data exfiltration.  

- **Unexpected domains** → look like legit ones but aren’t (e.g., `secure-bank-login.com` pretending to be `secure-bank.com`).  
  Attackers register look-alike domains for phishing or C2 comms.  

- **Strange file hashes** → files that don’t match normal baselines or match known malware signatures.  
  A hash hit in VirusTotal or threat intel means something’s off.  

- **Changes in the registry** → malware may create new Run or RunOnce keys to start automatically on boot.  

- **Suspicious processes running** → like `explorer.exe` or `svchost.exe` running from a temp folder instead of `C:\Windows\System32`.  
  That’s a red flag for persistence or masquerading.

### Realistic signs
- IP linked to a **C2 server**.  
- Fake domain that looks like a real banking website.  
- Malware adds itself to a Windows startup key.  
- File Explorer launching from `%TEMP%`.  

---

### Scenario
SOC analyst sees a PowerShell script reaching out to `185.33.211.22`.

- That IP might be flagged because it’s linked to a known C2 network.  
- The analyst should dig deeper — check if other systems also contacted it, inspect logs, and look for matching IOCs.

### Chain of events example
Phishing email → malware installed → registry key changed to run on startup → fake Windows Explorer process starts → connects to C2 IP `185.33.211.22`.
