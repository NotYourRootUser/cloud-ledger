# Centralized Logging and SIEM Integration

## Anchor
Send all network logs to a central location. Correlate events using a SIEM to detect patterns and anomalies.

Example: In AWS, use CloudWatch Logs and send them to Security Hub or GuardDuty for correlation.

## Recall
- Why centralize logs?
- What risks come from leaving logs only on local devices?
- What type of data does a SIEM analyze?
