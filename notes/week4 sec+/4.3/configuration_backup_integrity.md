# Configuration Backup and Integrity Checks

## Anchor
Network configurations should be backed up automatically and verified for integrity. Use hashes or checksums to detect tampering.

Example: Use Git to version control switch configs or use AWS Config for tracking drift in cloud environments.

## Recall
- Why is configuration integrity important?
- What is one benefit of storing configs in Git?
- What happens if backups are not encrypted?
