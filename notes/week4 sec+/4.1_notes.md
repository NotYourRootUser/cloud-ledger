# Security+ Domain 4.1 Implement Secure Network Designs

Network segmentation limits the blast radius and separates trust zones so that compromise does not spread.  
Public zone, DMZ, Private zone, and Management zone each have their own access controls and logging boundaries.

Zero Trust Network Architecture requires every packet, user, and device to authenticate. There is no implicit trust.  
Defense in Depth stacks multiple barriers: perimeter firewalls, subnet ACLs, host agents, and web application firewalls.

A VLAN is a logical fence, and microsegmentation adds policy-based isolation within the same subnet.  
Routing security maintains path integrity. Static routes are predictable; dynamic routes require filtering, BGP security, and RPKI.

Wireless networks are inherently open. WPA3 and 802.1X enforce encryption and identity.  
EAP methods carry credentials securely, and a RADIUS server validates each device before allowing communication.  
Guest isolation ensures visitors cannot access corporate systems.

VPNs extend private trust over public paths. IPsec encrypts at Layer 3, and SSL VPNs at Layer 7.  
Split tunneling provides convenience but increases risk. All traffic that leaves the office should travel in encryption.

Firewalls perform stateful inspection, remembering established connections.  
Stateless devices check each packet independently, while application firewalls understand and inspect payloads.  
A WAF protects HTTP traffic, and reverse proxies hide internal servers behind a public endpoint.

Load balancers distribute traffic and enhance availability, which also supports security through resilience.

In cloud and hybrid designs, the Internet Gateway exposes your VPC to the world, while a NAT Gateway allows outbound traffic without inbound exposure.  
Peering, Transit Gateways, and PrivateLink connect environments securely while maintaining isolation.  
The principle is consistent: connectivity without exposure.

Bastion hosts provide a single controlled entry point for administrators, using MFA, logging, and limited commands.  
Session Manager and Just-In-Time access further reduce exposure. Remote access should always be treated as a privilege.

Every pattern in this do-ain-VLAN, VPN, firewall, bastion, VPC-exists to contain trust, observe flow, and control exposure.  
Zero Trust is not a product; it is a posture. Segmentation turns philosophy into topology. Every connection must be earned.
