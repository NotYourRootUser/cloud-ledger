Here, the attacker puts malicious SQL into an input field. If the app doesnâ€™t handle it properly, the database runs those commands. That means the attacker can read, change, or delete data.  

**How to stop it:** use parameterized queries or prepared statements so user input is always treated as plain data, not part of the SQL command.  

**How to catch it:** keep an eye on DB query logs and WAF/IDS alerts for weird SQL-looking payloads (like `' OR '1'='1'` or `UNION SELECT`) or strange error patterns.
