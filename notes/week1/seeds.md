DoS/DDoS — Attacks that overwhelm a target’s resources or network with traffic to deny service to legitimate users; DoS = single source, DDoS = many distributed sources.


Vulnerability Scan — Automated scanning of systems, applications, or networks to identify known weaknesses, misconfigurations, or missing patches.
Credentialed scan (uses valid creds, deeper look at system configs).

Non-credentialed scan (no creds, limited to external view).

Buffer Overflow — An attack that sends more data to a memory buffer than it can hold, causing crashes or letting an attacker execute arbitrary code.
