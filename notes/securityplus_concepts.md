# Security+ Concepts

## IDS vs IPS
- IDS = Detects suspicious activity (out-of-band)
- IPS = Blocks malicious traffic (inline)

## VPN Modes
- Tunnel Mode = Encrypts header + payload (site-to-site)
- Transport Mode = Encrypts payload only (host-to-host)

## DMZ
- Buffer zone between internet and internal LAN
- Only expose necessary services (e.g., web servers)

## VLAN Segmentation
- Finance VLAN separated from Guest VLAN
- Restrict sensitive VLAN access to servers only
