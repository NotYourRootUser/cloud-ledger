# Session 2 — Network Indicators of Compromise (Network IOCs)

---

### What to look for
- **Unusual IP traffic or routing** → data sent to external IPs that aren’t in your normal flow.  
  If traffic suddenly routes to an unknown network or region, it could signal exfiltration or command-and-control.  

- **Unexpected jump in outbound data** → large, unexplained uploads might mean data exfiltration.  

- **Consistent communication at odd intervals** → regular connections every few seconds or minutes often point to **beaconing**.  

- **Encrypted data where it shouldn’t be** → if encrypted packets show up on ports that normally carry plain data, it might be tunneling or obfuscation.  

- **Multiple failed login attempts from a single IP** → could mean brute-force activity or credential stuffing.

### Key concepts
- **Beaconing** → when malware regularly communicates with or sends data to an external server.  
  Example: a host connecting every 60 seconds to `malicious-update[.]com`.  

- **DNS Tunneling** → when malware hides or “embeds” its data inside DNS traffic to bypass security tools.  
  It’s sneaky because DNS usually looks harmless.

### Scenario
User workstation is sending packets every 60 seconds to the same domain.  
You reason through it like this:
- If that domain is **expected and documented** (for example, a monitoring agent or patch server), it’s probably normal telemetry.  
- If it’s **unexpected**, not in any inventory, or registered recently, it’s likely **beaconing**.

### Applied — how to confirm
- **Wireshark:** capture traffic and check packet frequency, size, and destination. Look for repeated patterns or hidden payloads.  
- **VPC Flow Logs:** verify source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, and bytes transferred.  
  - Is the same host communicating out at exact intervals?  
  - Is data leaving on unusual ports (like DNS 53 or HTTP 8080)?  
  - Are there signs of encrypted payloads where none should exist?

Voice-seed this by explaining your logic out loud:
1. Describe each network IOC in your own words.  
2. Walk through the scenario and decide if it’s beaconing or normal telemetry.  
3. Narrate how you’d confirm it using Wireshark or Flow Logs — what patterns you’d look for and why.
