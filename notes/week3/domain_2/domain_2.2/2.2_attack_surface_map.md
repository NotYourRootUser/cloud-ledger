# Domain 2.2 — Threat Vectors & Attack Surfaces  
### Session 2 Notes — Attack Surface Mapping (Where the Risk Lives)

This session was about figuring out **where** the risk actually lives — not just how attackers get in, but what they can see, touch, or move through once they try.  
Basically, how big the “target” is and what parts of it are easiest to hit.

## What is an Attack Surface?

The **attack surface** is everything that can be attacked — all the systems, users, apps, APIs, and connections that an attacker could reach.  
Every login, device, or cloud endpoint increases it.  
Reducing it means cutting down what’s exposed or reachable.

So if attack vectors are *how* attacks start,  
then the **attack surface** is *where* those attacks can land.

## Layers of an Attack Surface

### 1. Assets  
All the stuff that needs protecting — hardware, software, data, users, cloud stuff, IoT devices, everything.  
Anything connected to the internet or a network counts.

### 2. Entry Points  
Places an attacker could use to get in:
- Logins, APIs, ports, Wi-Fi, email inboxes, remote desktops, physical doors.
If you can connect to it, attackers can too.

### 3. Trust Boundaries  
Where one system or user trust level ends and another begins.  
Like the wall between a public web server and an internal database, or between a normal user and an admin.

### 4. External vs Internal  
- **External** = public-facing (like websites, cloud storage, VPN portals).  
- **Internal** = inside the network (employee workstations, internal servers).  
Most breaches start outside → pivot inside.

## Example Scenarios

- **Cloud Web App:** Developer forgets to lock an S3 bucket → attackers find it through OSINT and grab data.  
- **Factory Network:** IoT sensors on old firmware → no patching → attacker uses one sensor to jump into the internal network.  
- **Office Environment:** Too many open ports on printers and routers → big, noisy attack surface.  
- **Home Worker:** Uses personal laptop with weak Wi-Fi password → attacker sits outside and brute forces the connection.

## Reflection 

When I was talking through this, it hit me that attack surface is like *the blueprint of everything that can go wrong.*  
You list everything: servers, users, access keys, routers, even coffee machine Wi-Fi if it connects.  
Then you ask: “Can someone reach it? Should they?”  
If yes → reduce it, patch it, or block it.

Also realized cloud changes everything.  
Old-school networks had fixed boundaries.  
Now everything’s connected to something else — your surface grows every time you add a SaaS app or a new API.

## How to Reduce the Surface

- Close unused ports.  
- Remove inactive accounts.  
- Disable guest Wi-Fi.  
- Use MFA on public logins.  
- Review API permissions regularly.  
- Segment networks (DMZs, VLANs, etc).  

Basically, make fewer ways in and fewer ways to move sideways.

## Key Idea

Mapping the attack surface =  
listing every asset → seeing how it connects → figuring out who or what can reach it.  
Reducing it =  
shutting doors, deleting keys, tightening trust boundaries.

---

**Summary Line:**  
Attack surface = total exposure.  
Map it, shrink it, monitor it — or someone else will.
