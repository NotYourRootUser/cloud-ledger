# Domain 2.1 — Threat Actors & TTP

## mitre attack framework
mitre attack framework - it documnets how an attacker might go about with achieving their goals 

## kill chain
kill chain - exact steps or stages they might follow to succed 

## attribution
attribution - identifying who was behind the attack and where it originated from. its hard becaues attackers are always hiding their tracks 

---

## Kill Chain Stages

### reconnaissance
reconnaissance - OSINT (try find public documentation to learn as much as they can)

### weaponization
weaponization - exploit prep (putting together the exploit to carry out the attack)

### delivery
delivery - phish email / USB (trying to place the exploit on the targets system)

### exploitation
exploitation - execute payload (victim opens the file or whatever action opens the payload)

### installation
installation - backdoor / persistance (exploit fully embedded in os)

### c2 (command and control)
c2 (command and control) - beaconing (attacker issuing the commands and controlling whats going on)

### actions on objectives
actions on objectives - exfil or disruption (steal data or disrupt to cause more chaos)

## mitre attack techniques
mitre attack techniques - phishing, credential dumping, lateral movement, data exfiltration.

---

## Mapping examples / notes

- phishing lines up with delivery in the kill chain because a common phisihing technique is sending out emails with malicious files pretending to be someone trustworthy to get them to install on their os  
- credential dumping can line up with either c2 or action on objectives depending on what the attacker wants  
- lateral movement could fit with c2 if the attacker wants the exploit to spread thoroughout the system and can also link to the installation phaes e because the explout could install itslef onto systems  
- data exfiltration is part of the actions on objectives phase thats when the attacker is stealing data from the victim

---

## attribution challenges include
- proxy infrastructure becasuse the attackers try to hide themselves that way by making a chain of connections to hide where the orignal traffic is coming from  
- false-flags - planting false evidence to misdirect analysts  
- shared malware code - like a form of a false flag in the form malware code  
- time-zone patterns - attackers spoof timezones to throw analysts off  
- confidence level low medium high is based on the evidence correlation 

---

## Intelligence Sources

- OSINT (open source intellegence) - public feeds, social media  
- HUMINT (human untellegence) - human intel, insider report  
- SIGINT (signals intellegence) - network traffic / C2 (command and control) scanning  
- SOC (security operations center) data + threat feeds + ISAC (information and analasys center) sharing 

---

## scenario

“Analyst traces ransomware using MITRE ATT&CK → finds T1059 PowerShell exec → links to known group.”

“Analyst correlates phishing domain registrations in Russian timezone → medium confidence nation-state tag.”  
they have moderate confidence that evidence is pointing towards nation state tag because of certain patterns like timezones countries linking it past attacks 

---

## Conclusions

Threat actors operate in patterns.  
TTP (tactic technique procedure) frameworks help us speak a common language for defense.  
Attribution is probabilistic, not certain — so we focus on indicators and response speed rather than blame.

## Summary line
summarize actor → motive → TTP = full picture of threat
