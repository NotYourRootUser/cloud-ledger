# Domain 2.1 — Threat Actors & Motivations  

This session connected everything from Domain 2.1 — learning how to compare different attackers not just by *why* they attack, but also by *how skilled* and *prepared* they are.

## Threat Actor Attributes

**Capability + Funding + Persistence = Threat Strength**

- **Nation-state / APT** — Very skilled and funded by governments. They stay hidden for long periods (months or years) and focus on spying or stealing secret information.  
- **Organized Crime** — Groups that attack for money. They use ransomware or steal data to sell it. Usually have good tools and enough funding to run many attacks.  
- **Hacktivist** — Attackers with political or social goals. They might take down websites (DDoS) or deface pages to spread a message. Often act in short bursts during events.  
- **Insider** — Employees or trusted people who misuse access for revenge or profit. Hard to detect because they already have legitimate system access.  
- **Script Kiddie** — Beginners who use ready-made tools found online. They don’t understand how the tools work but enjoy the attention or thrill.  
- **Competitor** — Rival companies or contractors who try to steal trade secrets or market data for an advantage.

## Using Threat Intelligence

- **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** — public information like websites, IPs, or social media used to find attacker details.  
- **HUMINT (Human Intelligence)** — information from people, such as insider reports or tips from law enforcement.  
- **SIGINT (Signals Intelligence)** — network data or communication logs that help detect hacker control servers.  
- **SOC / ISAC Feeds** — shared security data between companies and analysts to help everyone detect attacks faster.  

**Main idea:**  
Threat intelligence gives meaning to alerts. It helps analysts understand *who* might be attacking, *why* they’re doing it, and *how* to respond in time.

## Simple Scenarios

- **PowerShell beacon found:** A security analyst sees strange PowerShell activity, checks OSINT data, and realizes it matches the Conti ransomware group.  
  → Actor: Organized crime | Motive: Money | Action: Isolate systems and report to law enforcement.  

- **Leaked credentials found:** An analyst finds leaked passwords online and learns from HUMINT that an insider was paid to share them.  
  → Actor: Insider | Motive: Profit | Action: Enable user monitoring and alert HR.

## Quick Summary

Different attackers have different **skills, goals, and resources.**  
Frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK** and the **Kill Chain** help map how attacks happen.  
**Threat intelligence** helps link evidence and motives together.  
When you compare **Actor → Motive → TTP → Defense**, you see the full picture of a threat.
